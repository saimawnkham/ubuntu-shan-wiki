###Installation quirks

	libgd 2- xpm

When I installed my Ubuntu server, it installed [libgd 2-noxpm
](http://package.ubuntu.com/jaunty/libgd2-noxpm). This is a graphics library without [X pixmap (XPM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap) or font configuration (fontconfig)
support). However, Drupal requires [libgd2-xpm](http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/libgd2-xpm),which is used instead of libgd2-Xpm.Removing libgd 2-xpm doesn't appear to be trivial,
however.I could not remove it using apt,Adept,or KPackageKit.
 
However, Synaptic Package Manager does appear to remove libgd2-noxpm successfully,and
then libgd2-xpm can be installed.---
