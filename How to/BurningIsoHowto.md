###Downloading an Ubuntu ISO

Ubuntu is distributed over the Internet as DVD image (.iso) files. The GettingUbuntu page has links to the ISO image files, as well as other methods of getting Ubuntu.

###Burning the ISO on to a DVD

Unlike a regular data file, the ISO file cannot be simply dragged and dropped or copied directly onto a disc. It needs to be burned in a specific way that expands/extracts the image so you have usable files on your disc. 

To install Ubuntu from a DVD, you first need to burn the downloaded ISO image onto a DVD. This requires:

1. A working DVD burner (i.e. R/W drive)
2. A blank DVD. (recent Ubuntu versions do not fit on to CD any more)
Inexpensive "write once" DVD-Rs are a good choice for burning ISO images.


###Burning from Windows


####Windows 7/8/8.1

1. Right-click on an ISO image and choose “Burn disc image”.
